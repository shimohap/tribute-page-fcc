                Sven Magnus Øen Carlsen born 30 November 1990 is a Norwegian chess grandmaster, 
                No. 1 ranked player in the world and reigning World Chess Champion in classical and rapid. 
                His peak rating is 2882, the highest in history.
                Carlsen became a Grandmaster in 2004, at the age of 13 years, 
                148 days, making him the third youngest grandmaster in history. On 1 January 2010, 
                at the age of 19 years, 32 days, he became the youngest chess player in history to be 
                ranked world No. 1. In November 2013, Carlsen defeated Viswanathan Anand in the World 
                Chess Championship 2013, thus becoming the new world chess champion. On the May 2014
                FIDE rating list, Carlsen reached his top Elo rating of 2882,[1] the highest in history. 
                He successfully defended his title in November 2014, once again 
                defeating Viswanathan Anand. In 2015, he won the inaugural Grand Chess Tour, 
                a series of three supertournaments featuring the 10 best chess grandmasters in the world.
                Carlsen was known for his attacking style as a teenager but has since developed into a more universal player. 
                He does not focus on opening preparation as much as other top players and 
                plays a variety of openings, making it harder for opponents to prepare against him. 
                His positional mastery and endgame prowess have drawn comparisons to those of former 
                world champions José Raúl Capablanca, Vasily Smyslov, and Anatoly Karpov.
